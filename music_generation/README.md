# Song Generation with LSTM Language Model

This project aims to generate new songs using a language model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The model is trained on a dataset of songs, and then used to generate new songs by sampling from the learned probability distribution of characters.

## Background

Language modeling is a popular task in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, which involves predicting the next word or character in a sequence of text given its previous context. LSTM is a type of RNN that is well-suited for modeling long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it suitable for generating sequences of text, such as songs.

In this project, we use TensorFlow, a popular deep learning library, to build an LSTM-based language model for song generation. We train the model on a dataset of songs, which is preprocessed to convert text into numerical representations that can be fed into the model. The trained model learns the statistical patterns in the training data, such as the distribution of characters, and uses this knowledge to generate new songs.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `pipeline.py`: This is the main Python script that contains the code for training the LSTM language model. It loads the dataset of songs, preprocesses the text, builds and compiles the LSTM model, and trains it using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization. It also includes functions for generating new songs from the trained model.
- `music_gen.ipynb`: This is the notebook that was used as the primary editor for the project, including experimenting. 

- `README.md`: This README file that provides an overview of the project and its background.

- `model/training_checkpoints`: This directory stores the model checkpoints saved during training, which can be used to restore the trained model for generating songs.
- `tmp.wav`: This directory stores the temporary files that will be saved during training

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies, including TensorFlow and TensorFlow Datasets.

2. Download the dataset of songs using TensorFlow Datasets. You can modify the `songs` variable in the `pipeline.py` script to load a different dataset or split.

3. Configure the training parameters, such as the number of training iterations, batch size, and sequence length, in the `pipeline.py` script.

4. Run the `pipeline.py` script to train the LSTM language model. The model will be saved as checkpoints in the `model/training_checkpoints` directory during training.

5. After training, you can use the trained model to generate new songs by calling the `generate_song()` function in the `pipeline.py` script. You can specify the length and starting text of the generated song.

## Future Work

There are several possible improvements and extensions to this project, including:

- Experimenting with different model architectures, such as using different types of RNNs (e.g., GRU) or adding more layers to the model.

- Tuning hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, batch size, and sequence length, to find the optimal settings for training the model.

- Preprocessing the input data more thoroughly, such as removing special characters, lowercasing the text, or normalizing the lyrics to improve the quality of the generated songs.

- Evaluating the generated songs using quantitative metrics, such as BLEU score or perplexity, or conducting user studies to assess their quality from a subjective perspective.

- Deploying the trained model as a web application or mobile app for generating songs on-demand.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build an LSTM-based language model using TensorFlow for generating songs. By training the model on a dataset of songs, it learns the statistical patterns in the data and can generate new songs based on the learned patterns. The project can be extended and
